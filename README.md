### Generator of cities to sets of streets associations for RankCity App

 This tool allows the user to generate asociations of city to series of streets.
 A large number of asociations can be genereated from a simple user input: a list of city identifiers.
 We are constantly evaluating the generation algorithm. The choosen streets for a particular city should be "friendly to walk" streets, i.e.: not scary,dangerous or far from cities streets.
